\sekce Experience

% TODO: better name
\fancy{Optimisation Research
Intern}{\url{http://industrialinformatics.fel.cvut.cz}{Industrial Informatics
Research Center}, Czech Technical University, Prague}{June 2018–August 2020}
%
Research in scheduling and optimisation. Proved NP-hardness of a certain
periodic scheduling problem, developed a heuristic which solves even
moderate-sized instances efficiently. Primary author of the resulting paper,
which has been recently submitted for review.

\fancy{Research in Network
Flows}{\url{https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en/iuuk}{Computer Science Institute},
Charles University, Prague}{March 2020–present}
%
A part of a student grant and my bachelor's thesis. Research on the
multicommodity flow and the length-bounded flow problems, supervised by
\url{http://research.koutecky.name/}{Mgr. Martin Koutecký, Ph.D.}, with the aim
of discovering an exact polynomial-time combinatorial algorithm for both. As of now, we have proven
several strong theoretical properties and proposed a combinatorial algorithm
that works well in practice.

\sekce Education

\sekce Projects

\proj{\url{http://uralyx.cz/prog/outotune}{Outotune}}{real-time harmoniser}{2020}

A \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnpVAyPjxDA}{harmoniser} plugin with
VST3, LV2 and JACK integration written in \Cpp. Lets you sing harmonies in
real time using only your voice and a MIDI keyboard. Analyses your voice and
synthesizes it at different pitches.

\proj{\url{https://github.com/RichardHladik/rambajz}{Rambajz}}{real-time tuner
and spectogram}{2019}

Graphical real-time tuner and infinitely zoomable spectogram.
Written in C, using SDL and JACK, with emphasis on low latency and high
tuning precision.

% \proj{\url{https://github.com/RichardHladik/haskell-segtree}{haskell-segtree}}{polymorphic lazy segment tree}{2018}
% 
% Generic implementation of a persistent sparse lazy segment tree, which is able
% to work with arbitrary monoids. Written in Haskell.

\proj{\url{https://github.com/trinerdi/icpc-notebook}{icpc-notebook}}{collection of algorithms and data structures}{2016–2018}

A collection of algorithms and data structures which was used by our team at
the ACM ICPC World Finals 2018.
