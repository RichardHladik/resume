A second-semester student of the Computer science MSc programme at ETH Zürich.
Theoretical computer scientist at heart, but currently also trying to gain
experience in more practical fields, such as ML, bioinformatics, operation
research or software engineering.

I love pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and creating new and
meaningful things, especially in a group of similarly passionate people.

\sekce Experience

\exp{Mar.~2020–Jun.~2021}{Student Researcher}{%
%\url{https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en/iuuk}{Computer Science Institute},
Charles University, Prague.}

\list{o}
%
\: Algorithm research in {\bf networks flows} and {\bf convex optimisation}.
\: Proposed two {\bf new combinatorial algorithms} for the multicommodity flow
(MCF) problem.
\: {\bf Improved the state of the art} convergence for combinatorial MCF
algorithms from $\O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ to $\O(\log 1/\varepsilon)$ for
instances with small inflation rate.
%
%One of the algorithms stems from the Frank-Wolfe method, a projection-free convex optimisation method gaining popularity in ML.
%
%\: {\bf Journal article(s)} in progress.
%A part of a Student Faculty Grant and a
\: Superset of my \url{http://rihl.uralyx.cz/bc-thesis.pdf}{bachelor's thesis};
supervised by \url{http://research.koutecky.name/}{Martin Koutecký}.
Includes a {\bf C++ implementation.}%

\exp{June 2018–Dec.~2020}{\bf Student Researcher}{%\url{http://industrialinformatics.fel.cvut.cz}{Industrial Informatics Research Center},
Czech Technical University, Prague.}
%
%Part-time research,
%supervised by Anna Minaeva.
%
\list{o}
\: Optimisation research in {\bf scheduling}.
\: {\bf Proved NP-hardness} of a novel periodic scheduling problem, {\bf
developed} (\Cpp) several {\bf heuristics} for it.
\:
%The best one solves 98.4\% of non-overconstrained instances under $3$ minutes.
{\bf Decreased} the approximation error {\bf 10 times} compared to the base implementation.

\list{o}
\: Lets you {\bf sing harmonies} in real time by {\bf synthesising} the
chords you play on a keyboard {\bf using your voice.}

\: Along the way, I {\bf increased the performance} of an
open-source DSP library {\bf 3 times} by optimising FFT usage and data reuse.

\endlist

\nproj{{Machine Learning projects}}{Mar.~2018–Dec.~2022} Charles University \& ETH Zürich
%
\list{o}
