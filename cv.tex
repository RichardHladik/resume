%
A third-semester student of the Computer science MSc programme at ETH Zürich.
Theoretical computer scientist at heart, but currently also trying to gain
experience in more practical fields, such as ML, software engineering,
bioinformatics, or operation research.
%
Open source enthusiast.

I love pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and creating new and
meaningful things, especially in a group of similarly passionate people.

\list{o}
%
\: Worked as part of an airspace {\bf traffic detection} team.
\: Created a tool that matches neural network detections in camera images with aircraft GPS data, based on their (on-screen and 3D, respectively) movement patterns (Rust).

\list{o}
%
\: Algorithm research in {\bf network flows} and {\bf convex optimisation}. Basis for my \url{http://rihl.uralyx.cz/bc-thesis.pdf}{bachelor's thesis}.
\: {\bf Constructed} new {\bf algorithms} and investigated properties of their underlying combinatorial structure, in close collaboration with my
\url{http://research.koutecky.name/}{supervisor}. Also verified our intuitions practically (\Cpp, Python).
%\: Proposed two {\bf new combinatorial algorithms} for the multicommodity flow
%(MCF) problem.
\: {\bf Improved the state of the art} convergence of combinatorial
algorithms for the multicommodity flow problem {\bf exponentially}
% from polynomial to logarithmic
on instances with small inflation rate.
%
%One of the algorithms stems from the Frank-Wolfe method, a projection-free convex optimisation method gaining popularity in ML.

%
\list{o}
\: Optimisation research in {\bf scheduling}.
\: {\bf Proved NP-hardness} of a new periodic scheduling problem, proposed, discussed, {\bf
developed} and tested several {\bf heuristics} for it. Wrote auxiliary tools (e.g.~instance visualiser) in the process (\Cpp, Python).
