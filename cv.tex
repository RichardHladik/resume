%
A final-semester student of the Computer Science MSc programme at ETH Zürich. Currently writing my Master's thesis at BARC, University of Copenhagen. I'm passionate about graph theory, algorithms, and data structures, but I've been exploring other areas as well (differential privacy most recently).
%
%Open source enthusiast.
%
I love tackling interesting problems and pushing the boundaries of human
knowledge, especially in a group of similarly passionate people. }

\list{o}
\: Multiple projects on {\bf differential privacy} and {\bf instance optimality}. At the moment exploring tighter upper and lower bounds for differentially private minimum spanning trees.
%\: Multiple projects on {\bf differential privacy} and {\bf instance optimality}.
%\: Proposed a mechanism for privately releasing the minimum spanning tree that is {\bf universally almost-optimal} (gives an optimal expected error on every graph topology, up to a $\O(\log n)$ factor).
%\: We solve the almost 40-years-old open problem of Sorting Under Partial Information, 
\endlist

\exp{Apr.--Oct.~2023}{Research Project}{\I ETH Zürich}, supervisor: Bernhard Haeupler

\list{o}
\: We {\bf designed a heap} with a certain beyond-worst-case property and {\bf proved that Dijkstra's algorithm} using any heap with this property {\bf is universally optimal} (as fast as possible on every graph topology).
\endlist

\exp{Sep.~2022–Feb.~2023}{Software Engineering Intern}{\url{https://www.daedalean.ai/}{Daedalean}, Zürich}

\list{o}
%
%\: Developed a novel tool used to {\bf scale up model evaluation} without human annotation (Rust).
\: {\bf Designed} and {\bf implemented algorithms} for matching model detections with air traffic data based on their movement patterns, thus {\bf scaling up} model evaluation without human annotation.
%\: {\bf Devised} and {\bf analysed a heuristic} for deciding camera visibility of external air traffic.
