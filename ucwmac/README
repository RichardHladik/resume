This is ucwmac -- a set of TeX macros built on plain TeX

It was written by Martin Mares and several other authors and placed into
public domain.

============================================================================

This is a preview of ucwmac 2.0. Many new features were introduced, but their
exact behavior can still change. When we consider it stable enough, we will
release the real version 2.0.

To get the full feature set of ucwmac, please input ucwmac2.tex.
With bare ucwmac.tex, you will get backward-compatible behavior -- it will
still include most new features, but not all of them. In particular, default
settings of some parameters will differ.

Important changes in version 2:

  o  We now require a TeX engine based on e-TeX. This includes all modern
     TeX engines (pdfTeX, LuaTeX, XeTeX). Some features of ucwmac require
     pdfTeX (e.g., clickable links), some require LuaTeX (PDF meta-data).

  o  A new mechanism for lists was introduced. You can now use

	% An itemized list with bullets
	\list{o}
	\:first
	\:second
	\:third
	\endlist

	% A numbered list
	\list{n.}
	\:first		% 1. first
	\:second	% 2. second
	\endlist

	% Alphabetic list with parentheses
	\list{(a)}
	\:first		% (a) first
	\:second	% (b) second
	\endlist

     For more, see comments in ucwmac2.tex.

  o  Several problems in compatibility with LuaTeX have been fixed.

  o  The ucwmac now consists of several modules, which can be imported by
     \ucwmodule{module-name}. Repeated imports have no effect.

  o  Added macros for working with pdfTeX's color stack.

  o  Added a "link" module for producing clickable links.

  o  Added an "algo" module for typesetting algorithms. Since it typesets
     language-dependent strings, a simple localization mechanism is included.

  o  Added a "ref" module for maintaining cross-references.

  o  Added a "pdfmeta" module (LuaTeX only) for maintaining PDF metadata.

  o  Added a "luaofs" module for setting up Latin Modern fonts in LuaTeX via OFS.

  o  Introduced infrastructure for macros with optional parameters.
